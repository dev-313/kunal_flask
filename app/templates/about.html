  <h1 class="cover-heading">What is Flask?</h1>
  <p class="lead">Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries It is based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.</p>
  <p class="lead">In 2004, Pocoo was formed as an international group of Python enthusiasts. Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo:

    "It came out of an April Fool's joke but proved popular enough to make into a serious application in its own right."

When Ronacher and Georg Brandl created[when?] a bulletin board system written in Python, the Pocoo projects Werkzeug and the Jinja2 were developed, too.

Despite the lack of a major release, Flask has become extremely popular among Python enthusiasts. As of mid 2016, it was the most popular Python web development framework </p>
